Welcome to my Homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China. My research interests include event-based (or bio-inspired) vision, deep learning, object detection, and pose estimation.

I advocate for work-life balance, and this website mainly records my daily life. I will share some photographic works and lifeshots here from time to time.

In the future, I will keep track of the latest developments in my research field and share my views in the form of technical blogs. If you are interested, please follow me; if you need help or cooperation, please feel free to contact me via email.
