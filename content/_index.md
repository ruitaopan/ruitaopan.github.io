Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China. My research interests include event-based (or bio-inspired) vision, deep learning, object detection, and pose estimation.

I value work–life balance, and this website mainly serves as a record of my daily life. From time to time, I will share my photographic works and lifeshots here.

In the future, I plan to keep track of recent developments in my research field and share my thoughts through technical blog posts. If you are interested, feel free to follow me. For inquiries, collaboration, or academic discussions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.
